# My experience
My name is ZHAO Yi (赵羿).

I was born in Xiangxiang, a very small city in the south of China with around one million population. In the first sixteen years of my life, I had been staying in my hometown. During that period, I was very quiet and loved reading and playing video games. 

I had very good grades in the high school. At the age of 16, I was admitted into Zhejiang University with a rank of top 0.1% in the college entrance examination. Zhejiang University is located in Hangzhou, a middle-size city of more than ten million population, where I felt much more lonely and isolated because it was the first time I left my families and friends. During my college,I spent most of the time by myself.

In the last year of my undergraduate study, I was admitted into a joint-degree program between École Polytechnique and Zhejiang University. I get my master's degree at the age of 21.
