# My research
I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineering (IPESE)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ipese/) group at EPFL. I collaborate with TotalEnergies on the project "Transition to the Refinery of the Future" during my PhD.

As shown in the figure below, my thesis will cover several perspectives:

- A better understanding of today's refinery.

- Define the refinery of the future.

- Investigate the transition pathway to the future.

The research results have the opportunity to be validated by a real case study provided by the company.

## Team
Luckily, I never work alone and I received a lot of supports from my PhD supervisor, my managers at TotalEnergies and my colleagues.

<!-- **Abstract**: This project used two different approaches, which are Pinch Technology (PT) and mathematical modeling method using mixed integer nolinear programming (MINLP), to obtain optimal hydrogen network designs in a refinery. The hydrogen consuming and producing processes of an oil refinery were analyzed and identified. Computation of the missing information in the current scenario was conducted and then a reference case was established. With the focus on various purities, pressures and flowrates for the hydro-processing units, a pinch analysis was realized in order to set a target for the minimum hydrogen requirement of the system. A MINLP method was further created to optimize the hydrogen network with the objective functions to minimize the hydrogen consumption and the total annualized cost. A number of scenarios were analyzed considering different hydrogen production technologies and electricity suppliers. The results show that the scenario with the best economical performance is the one with hydrogen production from Steam Methane Reforming without Carbon and Capture and electricity supplied by a wind farm with a Total Annualized Cost of $142\:[M\:CHF/year]$. However, the one with hydrogen production from Steam Methane Reforming with Carbon Capture and electricity from a wind farm has the best overall performance with a total annualized Cost of $222\:[M\:CHF/year]$. The technologies using electrolysis for the production of hydrogen have the lowest `CO_2` emissions but are $98\:[M\:CHF/year]$ more expensive than the previous scenario. However, with the evolution of green hydrogen technologies, this cost gap is expected to decrease.  -->

<!-- **Abstract**: Under the scope of net zero emission, a large-scale deployment of renewable technologies, especially clean hydrogen is required. Hydrogen is a clean fuel and an ideal energy carrier that can be used to store, move, and deliver energy. Nowadays, most hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming or gasification of coal, with only less than 5\% of hydrogen produced by electrolysis. Among the electrolysis technologies, PEM electrolysis and SOE are favored of high hydrogen production rate and high energy efficiency, but the high cost hindered their further application. However, it is foreseeable that the cost of green hydrogen will decrease with the global shipment due to the learning effect. This reduction could result from the advancement of techniques or the economies of scale (SOE), but real mechanisms behind this correlation is still unclear. In this study, a comprehensive bottom-up cost estimation model was built and validated by industrial partners, the public database and specific literature. This model evaluated the cost of PEMEC and SOEC from several different perspectives, such as material cost, capital expenditure, utility cost, etc. Especially, the relationship between the cost and the factory throughput was addressed. It was found that the material cost in the CCM process has the biggest contribution and occupies 32% of the total cost. It’s of great importance to reduce the use of luxury materials in CCM. Regarding to EOS, the decrease of quotes of materials dominates when the production scale is relatively small. When the throughput of the factory is between 500 MW/y and 10000 MW/y, the continuing cost reduction is more brought by the higher utilization rate of equipment, manpower and buildings. The cost of SOEC is nearly constant and approaching the minimum marginal cost when the production volume exceeds 10000 MW/y. By associating the cost model with the learning curve and applying different parameters, this model has the potential to be applied to green hydrogen price forecasting and various industries. -->
