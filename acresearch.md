# My research
I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineering (IPESE)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ipese/) group at EPFL. I collaborated with TotalEnergies on the project "Transition to the Refinery of the Future" during my PhD.

As shown in the figure below, my thesis will address the issue from several perspectives:

- A better understanding of the today's refineries.

- Define the refinery of the future.

- Investigate the transition pathway to the future.

The research results have the opportunity to be validated by a real case study provided by the company.

# Team
Luckily, I never work alone and I received a lot of supports from my doctoral supervisor, my managers at TotalEnergies and my colleagues.

**Project**: Optimal hydrogen network in an refinery

**Abstract**: This project used two different approaches, which are Pinch Technology (PT) and mathematical modeling method using mixed integer nolinear programming (MINLP), to obtain optimal hydrogen network designs in a refinery. The hydrogen consuming and producing processes of an oil refinery were analyzed and identified. Computation of the missing information in the current scenario was conducted and then a reference case was established. With the focus on various purities, pressures and flowrates for the hydro-processing units, a pinch analysis was realized in order to set a target for the minimum hydrogen requirement of the system. A MINLP method was further created to optimize the hydrogen network with the objective functions to minimize the hydrogen consumption and the total annualized cost. A number of scenarios were analyzed considering different hydrogen production technologies and electricity suppliers. The results show that the scenario with the best economical performance is the one with hydrogen production from Steam Methane Reforming without Carbon and Capture and electricity supplied by a wind farm with a Total Annualized Cost of $142\:[M\:CHF/year]$. However, the one with hydrogen production from Steam Methane Reforming with Carbon Capture and electricity from a wind farm has the best overall performance with a total annualized Cost of $222\:[M\:CHF/year]$. The technologies using electrolysis for the production of hydrogen have the lowest `CO_2` emissions but are $98\:[M\:CHF/year]$ more expensive than the previous scenario. However, with the evolution of green hydrogen technologies, this cost gap is expected to decrease.
