# My research
Refinery, which seems to be a distant and rare concept for many people, is actually essential in our energy system and economy. Refinery plays a central role in the petroleum industry today, receiving crude oil extracted beneath the earth and converting it into variable valuable products, such as fuels for transportation, heating, road paving and electricity, and feedstocks for making plastics and textiles. However, due to the nature of fossil fuels, the refining process and its products currently account for around one third of global emissions. Today's refinery will have to take actions to reduce its emissions to respond to the global climate change and net-zero emission target, but at the same time keep providing reliable products and services to society.
